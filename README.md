Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications. It allows for creation of modular and adaptable software by following its principles. 
It also reduces risk of costly mistakes and project failures saving both time and resources as it encompasses following certain metholdologies.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Its Birth in the 1960s.  This involved writing software in a linear and unstructured format which made code difficult to understand, debug and maintain.
Emergence of OOP: It focused on a new paradigm that structured software around 'objects' representing real-world entities with attributes and methods.
Agile methodologies. It emphasized on iterative development, flexibility, customer collaboration and rapid delivery.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis: Involves gathering and analyzing business requirements.
Stakeholders, including clients, end-users, and project managers, collaborate to define what the software should accomplish.
Design: Planning the software architecture, including data flow, modules, and interfaces.
Implementation: Involves writing the actual code in a structured and modular way.
Testing: Involes ensuring the software works as expected, free of bugs and vulnerabilities.
Maintenance: Updating the software post-deployment to fix issues, adapt to new needs, and maintain compatibility.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
