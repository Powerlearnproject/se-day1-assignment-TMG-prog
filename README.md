#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications. It allows for creation of modular and adaptable software by following its principles. 
It also reduces risk of costly mistakes and project failures saving both time and resources as it encompasses following certain metholdologies.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Its Birth in the 1960s.  This involved writing software in a linear and unstructured format which made code difficult to understand, debug and maintain.
Emergence of OOP: It focused on a new paradigm that structured software around 'objects' representing real-world entities with attributes and methods.
Agile methodologies. It emphasized on iterative development, flexibility, customer collaboration and rapid delivery.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis: Involves gathering and analyzing business requirements.
Stakeholders, including clients, end-users, and project managers, collaborate to define what the software should accomplish.
Design: Planning the software architecture, including data flow, modules, and interfaces.
Implementation: Involves writing the actual code in a structured and modular way.
Testing: Involes ensuring the software works as expected, free of bugs and vulnerabilities.
Maintenance: Updating the software post-deployment to fix issues, adapt to new needs, and maintain compatibility.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is a sequential and linear approach where each phase of the Software Development Life Cycle must be completed before moving to the next while Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.
Waterfall has a rigid structure hence little room for changes while Agile is flexible and adaptable as requirements can evolve throughout the project based on customer feedback and new insights.
Waterfall involves extensive documentation at every stage to ensure clear project specifications and tracking while agile has minimal documentation and only focuses on essentials.
In waterfall customer involvement is limited to early stages while in agile customer involvement is continuous throughout development.

 Agile is ideal for projects where requirements are expected to change frequently such as startups and developing new products.
 Wterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined requirements, minimal expected changes, and a clear vision of the end product such as medical or aerospace software.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Responsible for coding, implementing, and debugging the software based on the specifications and designs provided. Responsible for coding, documenting code and designing the system architecture and structure of software modules.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Focus on testing the software to ensure it meets the specified requirements and functions without defects. Responsible fir test planning and design, manual and automated testing, defect documentation and tracking.

The Project Manager oversees the project from start to finish, ensuring it stays on track in terms of timeline, budget, and scope. Responsible for budget management, team co-ordination, stakeholder communication and risk management.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs  provide a cohesive environment for writing, testing, debugging, and compiling code. By combining multiple tools and features, IDEs make it easier for developers to work efficiently, maintain code quality, and enhance productivity. examples are Eclipse, Visual Studio Code and Netbeans Apache.
VCS tools are essential for tracking and managing changes in code, enabling teams to work on projects collaboratively and maintain a history of modifications. Examples are Git and Apache Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Managing Changing Requirements throughout a project due to new client needs, evolving business goals, or unforeseen technical constraints.
Frequent changes can disrupt planning, add complexity, and lead to delays.
Adopt Agile Methodologies which make it easier to incorporate changes. Regular sprints and client feedback allow teams to respond to new requirements efficiently.

Balancing Technical Debt. Technical debt refers to the shortcuts or suboptimal code implemented to meet deadlines. Set Time for Refactoring by allocating specific time within each sprint to improve or refactor older code. 

Debugging and Troubleshooting Complex Code. Breaking down the problem by Narrowing down the problem by isolating the bug, testing smaller components, or using logging to follow the code path.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of the codebase, typically at the smallest level of functionality. Unit testing isolates each part of the application, allowing for testing of  each function or component independently from the rest of the system.

Integration testing focuses on verifying that multiple components or modules work together as expected.It ensures that different parts of the system interact correctly and that interfaces between modules work as intended.

System testing examines the entire application as a whole to ensure that it meets specified requirements.It ensures that all components, when combined, work together to meet functional and non-functional requirements.

Acceptance testing is conducted to determine if the software meets business requirements and is ready for release. It ensures the software meets the end-user or client requirements and is fit for purpose.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
is the process of crafting and refining inputs to achieve specific, desired outputs from an AI model, particularly in language models like GPT.It allows users to guide the AI toward generating responses that are more accurate, coherent, and contextually relevant.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague:Write me an speech on corruption.
Improved: Write me a speech in English on the negative effects of corruption in Kenya. Be sure to sight statistics. Use correct grammar . Make the speech easy to understand. Incorporate anecdotes.

The improved prompt  tells the model what exaclty to include in the speech. It also informs the model that complex wording should be avoided as perharps the target audience will have varying educational levels.
